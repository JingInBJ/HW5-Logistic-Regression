    "\n",
    "> **Occupancy**\n",
    ">\n",

    "> **Action Type**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We wanted to look at the reasons lending institutions deny people a mortgage. After conversations with former officials at HUD, we decided to include only those applications that resulted in originations (action type 1) or denials (action type 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Income**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An applicant’s income isn’t always reported in the data. In other cases, the data cuts off any incomes over \\\\$9.9 million and any loan amounts over \\\\$99.9 million, meaning there’s a value in the database, but it’s not precise. We focused only on those records where income and loan amount have an accurate estimation. This meant discarding about 1 percent of all conventional home loans in the country for 2016. [Note: I already edited this]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When we plotted the number of applicants, how much money they made and the size of the loan, we found that it skewed to the left, meaning the majority of applicants were clustered on the lower end of the income and loan amount scales. This was especially true for applicants of color. We took the logarithm transformation of income and loan amount to normalize the distribution of those variables and limit the effect of extreme outliers.\n",

So we decided to combine race and ethnicity. Applicants who marked their ethnicity as Hispanic were grouped together as Hispanic/Latino regardless of race. Non-Hispanic applicants, as well as those who didn’t provide an ethnicity, were grouped together by race: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, etc. **[Note: This has already been taken care of]**\n",
